# ✈️ Airline Delay & Operational Performance Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes large-scale airline operational data to evaluate **on-time performance (OTP)**, **flight delays**, and **cancellations**.  
The goal is to identify **delay patterns**, **airport congestion hotspots**, and **operational reliability signals** that impact airline performance and decision-making.

The analysis focuses on **operational insight**, not just visualization.

## 📊 Dataset Summary
- **Total Flights Analyzed:** 625,000+  
- **Key Metrics Covered:**
  - On-Time Performance (OTP)
  - Delayed Flights
  - Cancelled Flights
  - Delay Percentage
  - Average Delay Minutes
- **Dimensions:**
  - Airports
  - Carriers
  - Time (Month, Season, Year)
  - Delay Causes (Weather, Late Arrival, Carrier, etc.)

---

## 🎯 Business Questions Addressed
- What percentage of flights are delayed or cancelled?
- Which airports experience the highest delay volume and severity?
- How do delays vary by **season**, **carrier**, and **location**?
- Are delays concentrated in high-traffic airports (congestion effect)?
- How do delays and cancellations relate operationally?

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Over **20% of flights experienced delays**, highlighting significant operational reliability challenges
- Certain high-traffic airports consistently showed **higher delay concentration**, indicating congestion-driven issues
- Delay patterns varied by **season and weather conditions**, with noticeable spikes during specific periods
- A positive relationship was observed between **delays and cancellations**, suggesting cascading operational effects

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – Data aggregation, KPI calculation, and filtering  
- **Python (Pandas)** – Data validation and exploratory analysis  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and KPI visualizations  
- **Excel** – Initial data inspection and checks  

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- Airline-wide **OTP, Delay %, and Cancellation KPIs**
- Airport-level congestion and delay comparisons
- Seasonal delay trend analysis
- Delay cause breakdown (weather, late arrival, carrier, etc.)
- Relationship analysis between delayed and cancelled flights

---

## 💡 Use Case
This dashboard can support:
- Airline operations teams monitoring daily performance
- Identification of delay-prone airports for operational review
- High-level performance reporting for reliability and efficiency tracking

---

## ⚠️ Notes & Limitations
- This analysis is **descriptive**, not predictive
- No forecasting or optimization models are included
- Root-cause analysis is based on observed patterns, not operational control data
